            <a href="https://betheltech.net/">Bethel School of Technology</a>
            graduate who is highly motivated to be a lifelong learner. In my
            previous career I worked for over a decade in the aviation field as
            a structural and electrical aircraft processor. Since 2015, I have been serving as a worship leader at my local church. I have learned how to
            keep schedule and manage my time effectively, as well as how to
            overcome challenges and be flexible. I have
            always had a passion for software and problem solving. I also enjoy
            Agile Developement practices and think I would be an excellent fit
            in that type of environment.

          <p>
            Throughout my journey of life I have been relatively content with
            how things were. I thought if I had a good job and could provide for
            my family then I could stay happy. This of course is not a bad
            thing, but I could feel more on my life. I had a few defining
            moments that I knew would shape how I approach my future. I began to
            discover a burning desire to make a difference in the tech space, to
            give myself over to that journey of discovery, and actually enjoy the
            process. I truly love working in this industry and everything it has
            to offer. I am not naive in thinking that I will always enjoy every
            aspect, but I do believe that even through the difficulties I can
            have a positive attitude and soak up knowledge through the process. This frees me to learn and grow
            from my mistakes. I believe I can thrive in those sometimes
            difficult hours of problem solving, and offer valuable solutions to
            contribute to an affective team.
